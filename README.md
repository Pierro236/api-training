## USERS-API

## To install  the dependencies do:

``` 
npm install

```

## Run the application :

```
npm start

```

## USE

This API works on the REST standard, collecting two main pieces of information: the enceintes and the users that go with them.

The application runs on port 3000 by default.

To test the api, you can use an api client like Postman or Insomnia.

## How does it work?

### With http://localhost:3000/enceintes
You can get all enceintes models
    
    
### With http://localhost:3000/users
You can perform four type of operations (Create - Read - Update - Delete)

- GET : Get all users

- POST : Create a new user in the database

### With http://localhost:3000/users/id

- GET : Get a specific user details

- UPDATE : Change the details of a specific user

- DELETE : Delete an user
